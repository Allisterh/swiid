"Data refer to resident employed households.  A resident employed household refers to a household headed by a resident (i.e. Singapore citizen or permanent resident) and with at least one working person.  Household income from work refers to the sum of income received by working members of the household from employment and business.  However, it does not include the income of maids.  Household income from work includes employer Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions.  Household income from work includes one-twelfth of annual bonus.  Data on household income from work refers to household income from work before accounting for Government transfers and taxes, unless stated otherwise.  The dollar values are in nominal terms.  More data and analyses on household income from work can be found in the paper 'Key Household Income Trends, 2017'.  The paper can be accessed via the following web-link: http://www.singstat.gov.sg/publications/publications-and-papers/population#household_income"

"GINI COEFFICIENT BASED ON HOUSEHOLD INCOME FROM WORK PER HOUSEHOLD MEMBER BEFORE ACCOUNTING FOR GOVERNMENT TRANSFERS AND TAXES - Internationally, there are differences in computation methods adopted by different countries, although the basic concept of Gini remains the same.  One major difference is in the equivalence scale adopted.  Equivalence scales take into account economies of scale within the household, and adjust for household size so that households with different sizes and compositions are comparable.  There are different scales used by different countries.  Household income from work per household member refers to the household income from work divided by the total number of members in the household.  For example, if there is one person in a household of four who is working, his income is divided by four to derive the income per household member."
"GINI COEFFICIENT BASED ON EQUIVALISED HOUSEHOLD INCOME FROM WORK BEFORE ACCOUNTING FOR GOVERNMENT TRANSFERS AND TAXES (BASED ON MODIFIED OECD SCALE) - Internationally, there are differences in computation methods adopted by different countries, although the basic concept of Gini remains the same.  One major difference is in the equivalence scale adopted.  Equivalence scales take into account economies of scale within the household, and adjust for household size so that households with different sizes and compositions are comparable.  There are different scales used by different countries.  The modified OECD scale assigns the first adult in the household a weight of 1 point, and each additional adult a weight of 0.5 points and each child a weight of 0.3 points.  Equivalised household income is derived by dividing the total household income by the sum of the points allocated to all the household members.  The modified OECD scale is used by Eurostat, the UK and Australia."
"GINI COEFFICIENT BASED ON EQUIVALISED HOUSEHOLD INCOME FROM WORK BEFORE ACCOUNTING FOR GOVERNMENT TRANSFERS AND TAXES (BASED ON SQUARE ROOT SCALE) - Internationally, there are differences in computation methods adopted by different countries, although the basic concept of Gini remains the same.  One major difference is in the equivalence scale adopted.  Equivalence scales take into account economies of scale within the household, and adjust for household size so that households with different sizes and compositions are comparable.  There are different scales used by different countries.  Gini based on the square root scale is derived based on the ranking of individuals by their household income on a per equivalised member basis (i.e. household income is divided by square root of household size).  This follows the approach adopted by Organisation of Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) in some reports.  In following this approach, individuals such as children and maids would also be ranked.  It is also noted that some OECD countries publish their own Gini using a different equivalence scale, and not the square root scale."

Data on income after accounting for government transfers and taxes for 2017 are preliminary.  Similar to past practices, as more administrative data on Government transfers or taxes become available, the coverage has been expanded to include more types of transfers."
