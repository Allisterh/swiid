It is equal to "0" in the case of total earnings/income equality (everyone receives the same earnings/income) and to "1" in the case of total inequality (one person receives all the earnings/income). In this table it is interpolated from group data for monthly earnings, with bonuses, for full-time employees as reported by employers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              -                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Distribution of income: Gini coefficient                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The "Gini" is a measure of the degree of inequality in the distribution of earnings and income. It is equal to "0" in the case of total earnings/income equality (everyone receives the same earnings/income) and to "1" in the case of total inequality (one person receives all the earnings/income). In this table estimates are based on interpolated distributions from grouped data from household budget surveys reported to the MONEE project, unless otherwise stated. The procedure is described in Atkinson and Micklewright (1992), "Sources and Methods". Economic Transformation in Eastern Europe and the Distribution of Income. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Survey coverage may vary over time. Data refer to the distribution of individuals according to household per capita income.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              -                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The Country Specific Variable Notes for your selection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              --                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                ---- Czech Republic ----                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              -    Distribution of income: Gini coefficient                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              --        a.
